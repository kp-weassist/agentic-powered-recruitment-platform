# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Create a modern, intuitive platform that feels consumer-grade despite being B2B software. The interface should guide users through complex workflows without requiring training, using progressive disclosure to avoid overwhelming new users while providing power features for experienced recruiters. Every interaction should feel fast and responsive, with real-time updates and minimal page refreshes.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Card-based layouts** for job postings and candidate profiles enabling quick scanning
- **Kanban-style pipeline views** for managing candidates through hiring stages
- **Inline editing** throughout the platform to reduce context switching
- **Command palette** (Cmd+K) for power users to quickly navigate and execute actions
- **Real-time collaboration** with presence indicators and live updates
- **Smart defaults and templates** reducing setup time for common tasks
- **Contextual AI assistance** providing suggestions without being intrusive

## Core Screens and Views

- **Dashboard** - Personalized overview with key metrics, pending actions, and AI insights
- **Job Posting Creator** - Multi-step wizard with AI assistance and preview
- **Candidate Pipeline** - Kanban board for managing applicants through stages
- **AI Matching Results** - Ranked candidate list with match explanations and quick actions
- **Candidate Profile** - Comprehensive view with resume, assessments, notes, and history
- **Assessment Center** - Test creation, assignment, and results analysis
- **Team Collaboration** - Shared candidate reviews and feedback collection
- **Analytics Dashboard** - Recruiting metrics, funnel analysis, and performance tracking
- **Settings & Admin** - Organization, user, subscription, and integration management
- **Candidate Portal** - Application tracking, profile management, and job recommendations

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The platform will meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, sufficient color contrast, focus indicators, and alternative text for all images. Forms will include proper labeling and error messaging. The interface will be tested with assistive technologies.

## Branding

Clean, professional design with customizable employer branding including logo, colors, and custom domains for career pages. The default theme uses a modern color palette with blue primary colors conveying trust and purple accents for AI-powered features. Typography will be clean and readable with system fonts for fast loading.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on desktop web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge) with fully responsive design adapting to tablets and mobile devices. Progressive Web App capabilities for mobile users enabling app-like experience without native apps. Offline support for critical features using service workers.
