## Background Context

The recruitment industry is experiencing a fundamental shift as companies struggle with inefficient hiring processes averaging 42 days per position while recruiters spend 65% of their time on administrative tasks. Current ATS solutions fail to leverage modern AI capabilities, forcing companies to use 5-7 different tools that create data silos and poor candidate experiences. With 75% of employers reporting difficulty finding qualified candidates despite receiving hundreds of applications, there's a critical need for intelligent systems that can process high volumes while improving match quality.

Our platform addresses this by being AI-native from the ground up, integrating assessments directly into workflows, and providing one-day implementation versus weeks for enterprise solutions. Inspired by GoPerfect's matching capabilities but expanding to full-stack ATS functionality, we're targeting the underserved mid-market segment (50-500 employees) that needs sophisticated capabilities without enterprise complexity and pricing.
