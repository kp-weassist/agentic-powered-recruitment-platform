# Epic 4: AI Matching Engine

Develop and integrate the intelligent matching system that analyzes candidates against job requirements. This epic delivers the core AI differentiation connecting qualified candidates with relevant opportunities.

## Story 4.1: Vector Embedding Generation

As a system architect,
I want to generate embeddings for jobs and candidates,
so that semantic matching is possible.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Text preprocessing pipeline for consistent input
2: Embedding generation using sentence transformers
3: Vector storage in dedicated database (Pinecone/Weaviate)
4: Batch processing for efficiency
5: Embedding updates when profiles/jobs change
6: Quality metrics for embedding consistency
7: Fallback for embedding service failures

## Story 4.2: Matching Algorithm Implementation

As a platform administrator,
I want an accurate matching algorithm,
so that quality matches are produced.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Cosine similarity calculation for vector matching
2: Multi-factor scoring including skills, experience, location
3: Configurable weight parameters for tuning
4: Match explanation generation
5: Minimum threshold filtering
6: Performance optimization for real-time queries
7: A/B testing framework for algorithm improvements

## Story 4.3: Candidate Recommendation Service

As an employer,
I want AI-recommended candidates for my jobs,
so that I can find qualified talent quickly.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Top 20 candidate recommendations per job
2: Match scores with explanation
3: Daily recommendation updates
4: Filtering by match threshold
5: Recommendation refresh on demand
6: Bulk recommendation for multiple jobs
7: Export recommendations to CSV

## Story 4.4: Job Recommendation Service

As a candidate,
I want personalized job recommendations,
so that I discover relevant opportunities.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Daily job recommendations based on profile
2: Preference learning from application behavior
3: Recommendation explanation (why this job?)
4: Save/dismiss recommendations
5: Email digest option with top matches
6: Recommendation improvement from feedback
7: Location and salary preference filtering

## Story 4.5: Match Quality Analytics

As a platform administrator,
I want to track matching performance,
so that we can improve the algorithm.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Match-to-interview conversion tracking
2: Match-to-hire conversion tracking
3: Employer feedback on match quality
4: Candidate feedback on recommendations
5: A/B test results dashboard
6: Bias detection in matching patterns
7: Regular algorithm performance reports
