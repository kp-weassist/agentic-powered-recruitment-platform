# Agentic Powered Recruitment Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Reduce time-to-hire by 70% through AI-powered candidate matching and automated workflows
- Achieve 60% AI match-to-interview conversion rate demonstrating superior matching accuracy
- Enable recruiters to handle 3x more positions through intelligent automation
- Deliver seamless candidate experience with 85% satisfaction scores
- Establish platform as primary ATS for 500 mid-market companies within 12 months
- Generate $3M ARR by end of Year 1 with 40% gross margins
- Create integrated assessment platform eliminating need for separate tools
- Build deep LinkedIn integration beyond basic API connections

### Background Context

The recruitment industry is experiencing a fundamental shift as companies struggle with inefficient hiring processes averaging 42 days per position while recruiters spend 65% of their time on administrative tasks. Current ATS solutions fail to leverage modern AI capabilities, forcing companies to use 5-7 different tools that create data silos and poor candidate experiences. With 75% of employers reporting difficulty finding qualified candidates despite receiving hundreds of applications, there's a critical need for intelligent systems that can process high volumes while improving match quality.

Our platform addresses this by being AI-native from the ground up, integrating assessments directly into workflows, and providing one-day implementation versus weeks for enterprise solutions. Inspired by GoPerfect's matching capabilities but expanding to full-stack ATS functionality, we're targeting the underserved mid-market segment (50-500 employees) that needs sophisticated capabilities without enterprise complexity and pricing.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Create a modern, intuitive platform that feels consumer-grade despite being B2B software. The interface should guide users through complex workflows without requiring training, using progressive disclosure to avoid overwhelming new users while providing power features for experienced recruiters. Every interaction should feel fast and responsive, with real-time updates and minimal page refreshes.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Command palette** (Cmd+K) for power users to quickly navigate and execute actions
- **Real-time collaboration** with presence indicators and live updates
- **Smart defaults and templates** reducing setup time for common tasks
- **Contextual AI assistance** providing suggestions without being intrusive

### Core Screens and Views

- **Dashboard** - Personalized overview with key metrics, pending actions, and AI insights
- **Job Posting Creator** - Multi-step wizard with AI assistance and preview
- **Candidate Pipeline** - Kanban board for managing applicants through stages

### Branding

Clean, professional design with customizable employer branding including logo, colors, and custom domains for career pages. The default theme uses a modern color palette with blue primary colors conveying trust and purple accents for AI-powered features. Typography will be clean and readable with system fonts for fast loading.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on desktop web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge) with fully responsive design adapting to tablets and mobile devices. Progressive Web App capabilities for mobile users enabling app-like experience without native apps. Offline support for critical features using service workers.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing all services, shared libraries, and deployment configurations. Clear package boundaries with `apps/` for services, `packages/` for shared code, `infrastructure/` for IaC. Yarn workspaces for dependency management and build orchestration.

### Service Architecture

Microservices architecture within the monorepo:
