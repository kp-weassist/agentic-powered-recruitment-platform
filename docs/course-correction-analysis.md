# Sprint Change Proposal - Initial Project Alignment Review

## Analysis Summary

This course correction analysis was conducted proactively after PRD creation to ensure alignment between project documentation and implementation approach. No critical issues were identified, but several optimization opportunities and risk mitigation strategies have been documented.

## Current Project State

- **PRD Status:** Complete with 6 epics and 35 stories
- **Architecture:** Pending (next step)
- **Key Risks Identified:** LinkedIn API dependency, AI accuracy expectations, MVP scope creep
- **Timeline:** 6-month MVP target

## Risk Mitigation Recommendations

### 1. LinkedIn API Dependency

**Issue:** Heavy reliance on LinkedIn API creates single point of failure

**Recommended Adjustments:**
- Add fallback data sources in Epic 4 (Story 4.1)
- Create manual profile import options early
- Implement LinkedIn API monitoring and alerts
- Consider alternative professional network integrations

### 2. AI Matching Accuracy

**Issue:** 60% match-to-interview target is aggressive for MVP

**Recommended Adjustments:**
- Start with 40% target for MVP, increase to 60% post-launch
- Add Story 4.6: "Manual Match Override System" to Epic 4
- Implement comprehensive A/B testing from day one
- Create feedback loops in Story 4.5 earlier (move to Epic 1)

### 3. MVP Scope Management

**Issue:** 35 stories across 6 epics is ambitious for 6-month timeline with 8-10 engineers

**Recommended Adjustments:**
- Consider moving Epic 5 (Assessments) to Phase 2
- Reduce initial assessment count from 10 to 4 (2 technical, 2 soft skills)
- Implement progressive rollout strategy
- Add buffer time between epics for integration and stabilization

## Epic Sequence Optimization

### Current Sequence (Good)
1. Foundation & Authentication ✓
2. Job Management ✓
3. Candidate Experience ✓
4. AI Matching ✓
5. Assessments ✓
6. Collaboration ✓

### Recommended Adjustment
Consider parallel development tracks:
- **Track A:** Epic 1 → Epic 2 → Epic 6
- **Track B:** Epic 1 → Epic 3 → Epic 4
- **Track C:** Epic 5 (can start after Epic 3)

This allows for better resource utilization and reduces dependencies.

## Technical Architecture Considerations

### Recommended Early Decisions
1. **Vector Database Selection:** Pinecone vs Weaviate - POC needed before Epic 4
2. **Assessment Engine:** Build vs integrate with existing platform
3. **Real-time Updates:** WebSockets vs Server-Sent Events vs Polling
4. **Multi-tenancy Strategy:** Database isolation approach

### Performance Targets Validation
- 10,000 concurrent users may be over-specified for MVP
- Consider starting with 1,000 concurrent users, scale infrastructure as needed
- API response time < 500ms is good, but prioritize matching accuracy over speed initially

## Story-Level Adjustments

### Epic 1 Additions
- **Story 1.8:** Observability and Monitoring Setup (critical for production readiness)
- **Story 1.9:** Feature Flag System Implementation (enables progressive rollout)

### Epic 4 Modifications
- Split Story 4.2 (Matching Algorithm) into:
  - 4.2a: Basic Keyword Matching (MVP)
  - 4.2b: Advanced AI Matching (Post-MVP)

### Epic 6 Simplification
- Combine Stories 6.2 and 6.3 into single "Team Collaboration Suite"
- Move Story 6.5 (Analytics Dashboard) to Phase 2

## Artifact Update Requirements

### PRD Updates Needed
- [ ] Adjust KPI targets for MVP (match accuracy 40% → 60% over time)
- [ ] Add feature flag strategy to NFRs
- [ ] Update epic dependencies to reflect parallel tracks
- [ ] Add Story 1.8 and 1.9 to Epic 1

### Architecture Document Guidance
- [ ] Design for LinkedIn API abstraction layer
- [ ] Include fallback strategies for all external dependencies
- [ ] Plan for horizontal scaling from day one
- [ ] Consider event-driven architecture for better decoupling

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Review and approve this change proposal** - Ensure alignment on adjustments
2. **Update PRD with approved changes** - Incorporate risk mitigations and optimizations
3. **Create Architecture Document** - Use insights from this analysis
4. **Conduct LinkedIn API feasibility study** - Critical path item
5. **POC for vector database selection** - Impacts Epic 4 implementation

### Agent Handoffs
- **Architect:** Create architecture with emphasis on resilience and scalability
- **Dev Team:** Begin Epic 1 with parallel track consideration
- **UX Expert:** Start wireframes for Epic 2 and 3 core screens

## Success Criteria

This course correction is successful when:
- [ ] LinkedIn API dependency is abstracted with fallbacks
- [ ] AI matching expectations are properly set (40% MVP, 60% target)
- [ ] Development tracks are parallelized for efficiency
- [ ] Critical technical decisions have POCs completed
- [ ] MVP scope is achievable within 6-month timeline
