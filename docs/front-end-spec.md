```

### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:** Persistent left sidebar with icon + label navigation for main sections (Dashboard, Jobs, Candidates, Assessments, Team, Analytics, Settings). Collapsible to icon-only mode for more screen space.

**Secondary Navigation:** Horizontal tabs within each primary section for subsections. Breadcrumb trail shows current location and enables quick navigation up the hierarchy.

**Command Palette:** Global Cmd+K search for quick navigation to any screen, job, or candidate. AI-powered suggestions based on recent activity and common tasks.

## User Flows

### Employer: Post a New Job

**User Goal:** Create and publish a job posting to attract qualified candidates

**Entry Points:** Dashboard quick action, Jobs section, or command palette

**Success Criteria:** Job posted and receiving applications within 5 minutes

#### Flow Diagram

    L -->|Yes| M[Published]
    L -->|No| N[Save Draft]
    M --> O[Share Link]
    N --> P[Schedule Publishing]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- Duplicate job title warning with option to proceed
- Auto-save every 30 seconds prevents data loss
- Validation errors shown inline without losing progress
- Network failure queues job for retry with notification

**Notes:** AI assistance available at each step but never required. Smart defaults based on previous jobs and industry standards.

### Candidate: Apply for a Job

**User Goal:** Successfully apply for a relevant job opportunity

**Entry Points:** Job board, email link, or recommendations dashboard

**Success Criteria:** Application submitted with confirmation within 3 minutes

#### Flow Diagram

    I --> J[Custom Questions]
    J --> K[Review Application]
    K --> L[Submit]
    L --> M[Confirmation]
    M --> N[Track in Dashboard]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- Resume parsing errors show manual entry option
- Timeout protection saves progress for 24 hours
- Duplicate application prevention with clear messaging
- File size/format validation with helpful error messages

**Notes:** One-click apply for returning users with saved profiles. LinkedIn import option available for faster profile creation.

### Recruiter: Review AI Matches

**User Goal:** Efficiently review AI-recommended candidates and take action

**Entry Points:** Job dashboard, email notification, or AI matches section

**Success Criteria:** Review 20 candidates and shortlist 5 in under 10 minutes

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Job Dashboard] --> B[View AI Matches]
    B --> C[Ranked Candidate List]
    C --> D[Quick Preview Card]
    D --> E{Interested?}

    E -->|No| G[Skip/Reject]
    E -->|Maybe| H[Save for Later]
    F --> I[Assign Stage]
    G --> J[Provide Feedback]
    H --> K[Add Note]
    I --> L[Bulk Actions]
    J --> M[AI Learns]
    K --> L
    L --> N[Send Messages]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- No matches found triggers alternative search suggestions
- Conflicting team decisions highlighted for resolution
- Bulk operation limits (max 50) with queuing for larger sets
- Undo option for accidental rejections (30-second window)

**Notes:** Keyboard shortcuts enable rapid review (J/K to navigate, Y/N for yes/no, S to save). AI explanations available on hover but not intrusive.

## Accessibility Requirements

### Compliance Target
**Standard:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA

### Key Requirements

**Visual:**
- Color contrast ratios: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Focus indicators: 2px solid outline with 2px offset
- Text sizing: Supports 200% zoom without horizontal scroll

**Interaction:**
- Keyboard navigation: All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- Screen reader support: ARIA labels and live regions for dynamic content
- Touch targets: Minimum 44x44px for mobile interfaces

**Content:**
- Alternative text: Descriptive alt text for all informative images
- Heading structure: Logical h1-h6 hierarchy
- Form labels: Associated labels for all form inputs

### Testing Strategy
Automated testing with axe-core, manual testing with NVDA/JAWS, real user testing with users who have disabilities

## Responsiveness Strategy

### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Mobile | 320px | 639px | Phones |
| Tablet | 640px | 1023px | Tablets, small laptops |
| Desktop | 1024px | 1535px | Laptops, desktops |
| Wide | 1536px | - | Large monitors |

### Adaptation Patterns

**Layout Changes:** Sidebar becomes bottom navigation on mobile. Multi-column layouts stack vertically. Modals become full-screen sheets.

**Navigation Changes:** Hamburger menu on mobile. Tab navigation becomes dropdown. Breadcrumbs hidden on mobile.

**Content Priority:** Hide secondary information on mobile. Progressive disclosure through expandable sections. Critical actions always visible.

**Interaction Changes:** Swipe gestures for mobile navigation. Long press for context menus. Pull-to-refresh for content updates.

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles
Fast and subtle animations that provide feedback without slowing users down. Follow material design timing curves. Respect prefers-reduced-motion settings.

### Key Animations
- **Page Transitions:** Fade with subtle slide (200ms, ease-out)
- **Card Hover:** Subtle elevation change (150ms, ease-in-out)
- **Loading States:** Skeleton screens with shimmer (infinite, linear)
- **Drag and Drop:** Smooth follow with ghost element (instant, linear)
- **Success Feedback:** Checkmark draw animation (400ms, ease-out)
- **AI Processing:** Purple gradient pulse (2s, ease-in-out)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals
- **Page Load:** < 2 seconds on 3G connection
- **Interaction Response:** < 100ms for user input
- **Animation FPS:** Consistent 60fps for all animations

### Design Strategies
Lazy load images below the fold. Virtual scrolling for long lists. Optimistic UI updates with rollback on error. Progressive enhancement for complex features. CDN delivery for all static assets.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Create high-fidelity mockups in Figma for all primary screens
2. Develop interactive prototype for user testing
3. Conduct usability testing with 5 users per persona
4. Create component documentation in Storybook
